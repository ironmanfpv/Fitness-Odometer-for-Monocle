# Fitness Odometer
Jogging is a good cardiovascular exercise that many engage in. 
What is the route that you have taken ? How far have you ran? 
This repo explores how to have the metrics on demand.

This repository is for the tracking module proof of concept for HTML. üî•

## To run the web app

- Access https://ironmanfpv.github.io/Fitness-Odometer-for-Monocle/index.html in browser.
- If you fail to load the app, check the [browser compatibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API#browser_compatibility).

- The app requires your permission to retrieve your geolocation.
- No geolocation is collected and sent to any server.

## Development

- The app relies on Mozilla Web Geolocation API.
- Latitude and longitude are the only information available through the API.
- Currently a proof of concept for Geolocation

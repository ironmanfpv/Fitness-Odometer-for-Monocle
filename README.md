What is the route that one have taken ? How far have you ran? </br>

## To run the web app

- Access https://ironmanfpv.github.io/Fitness-Odometer-for-Monocle/index.html in browser.
- The web app can be used independently on the iPhone, with and without Monocle.
- If you fail to load the app, check the [browser compatibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API#browser_compatibility).

- The app requires your permission to retrieve your geolocation.
- No geolocation is collected and sent to any server.

## To connect web app to Monocle

- By connecting web app to Monocle, visual Odometer is available.
- Works with iPhone and Bluefly; a BLE enabled browser.
- Hit the Connect! button and select Monocle from the list of BLE device that appears in the list.
- HIt the Transmission button and the distance information will be displayed on your Monocle. 

## Development

- The app relies on Mozilla Web Geolocation API.
- Latitude and longitude are the only information available through the API.
- Currently a proof of concept for Geolocation, and successful integration with Monocle.
